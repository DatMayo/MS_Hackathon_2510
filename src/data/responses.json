In the social sciences, a rumor involves a form of a statement whose truthfulness or honesty is not quickly or ever confirmed. In addition, some scholars have identified rumor as a subset of propaganda. Sociology, psychology, and communication studies have widely varying definitions of rumor. Rumors are also often discussed with regard to misinformation and disinformation (the former often seen as simply false and the latter seen as deliberately false, though usually from a government source given to the media or a foreign government).",

    "title": "Elvis Presley death conspiracy",
    "summary": "Since Elvis Presley's death on August 16, 1977, various false and discredited conspiracy theories have circulated stating that he may still be alive. Elvis sightings from people incorrectly claiming to have seen him after this date are a phenomenon both as an ironic meme and also as part of a genuine belief for some. In the early 1980s, the possibility of Presley still being alive was a niche topic discussed by a fringe demographic of fans in underground zines. It crossed over into widespread media attention in 1987 after a woman named Louise Welling falsely claimed to have seen Elvis at a Burger King in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The absurdity, Middle America-ness and the sound of the name Kalamazoo made for an ironic, light story in newspaper and television outlets. Theories and misinformation on the topic were then widely popularised by authors Gail Brewer-Giorgio and Major Bill Smith, who were given a platform by American and international media. Two TV specials on the subject of Elvis sightings, The Elvis Files and The Elvis Conspiracy, aired internationally in 1991 and 1992. Since then, popular interest in the topic has waned but Elvis sightings have stayed resonant as a part of pop culture. The conspiracy theory itself has become iconic as an example of the genre  and a forerunner of the post-truth era, going on to influence many other theories including QAnon.",

    "title": "Flat Earth",
    "summary": "Flat Earth is an archaic and scientifically disproven conception of the Earth's shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat-Earth cosmography. The model has undergone a recent resurgence as a conspiracy theory in the 21st century. The idea of a spherical Earth appeared in ancient Greek philosophy with Pythagoras. However, the early Greek cosmological view of a flat Earth persisted among most pre-Socratics (6th–5th century BC). In the early 4th century BC, Plato wrote about a spherical Earth. By about 330 BC, his former student Aristotle had provided strong empirical evidence for a spherical Earth. Knowledge of the Earth's global shape gradually began to spread beyond the Hellenistic world. By the early period of the Christian Church, the spherical view was widely held, with some notable exceptions. In contrast, ancient Chinese scholars consistently describe the Earth as flat, and this perception remained unchanged until their encounters with Jesuit missionaries in the 17th century. Muslim scholars in early Islam maintained that the Earth is flat. However, since the 9th century, Muslim scholars have tended to believe in a spherical Earth. It is a historical myth that medieval Europeans generally thought the Earth was flat. This myth was created in the 17th century by Protestants to argue against Catholic teachings, and gained currency in the 19th century. Despite the scientific facts and obvious effects of Earth's sphericity, pseudoscientific flat-Earth conspiracy theories persist. Since the 2010s, belief in a flat Earth has increased, both as membership of modern flat Earth societies, and as unaffiliated individuals using social media. In a 2018 study reported on by Scientific American, only 82% of 18 to 24-year-old American respondents agreed with the statement I have always believed the world is round. However, a firm belief in a flat Earth is rare, with less than 2% acceptance in all age groups.",

    "title": "Illuminati",
    "summary": "The Illuminati plural of Latin illuminatus, enlightened is a name given to several groups, both real and fictitious. Historically, the name usually refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on 1 May 1776 in the Electorate of Bavaria. The society's stated goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life, and abuses of state power by monarchs. The order of the day, they wrote in their general statutes, is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them. The Illuminati—along with Freemasonry and other secret societies—were outlawed through edict by Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, with the encouragement of the Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787 and 1790. During subsequent years, the group was generally vilified by conservative and religious critics, who claimed that the Illuminati continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution. It attracted literary men such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder and the reigning Duke of Gotha and of Weimar. In subsequent use, Illuminati has been used when referring to various organisations alleged to be a continuation of the original Bavarian Illuminati (though these links have not been substantiated). These organisations have often been accused of conspiring to control world affairs, by masterminding events and planting agents in governments and corporations, in order to gain political power, influence and to establish a New World Order. Central to some of the more widely known and elaborate conspiracy theories, the Illuminati are depicted as lurking in the shadows and pulling the strings and levers of power. This view of the Illuminati has found its way into popular culture, appearing in dozens of novels, films, television shows, comics, video games and music videos.",

    "title": "UFO flap",
    "summary": "A UFO flap is a rash of reports of unidentified airborne objects. Flap, originally a military term to describe a period of panic or chaos, is used by ufologists to describe surges of sightings in one geographical area. Longer surges spanning multiple countries may be called waves. Reported sightings of UFOs, public interest in them, and news coverage are highly variable in frequency. UFO, flap, and wave allow for sightings of various unrelated phenomena in the night sky to be discussed as if they are parts of the same aerial event. Documenting the provenance of the idea of UFO flap, Wired journalist Sarah Scoles identified how the term was first associated with the 1947 flying saucer craze: Arnold's sighting, however he felt about it, began an epidemic. Soon, other people around the US started to see their saucers. The night sky opened up, kicking off a ufological period insiders refer to as a flap: a period of increased sightings. The term also has the contextual tinge of the word's other definition, an increased state of agitation. Edward Ruppelt, an Air Force officer who would go on to be part of governmental UFO investigations, wrote that in Air Force terminology a 'flap' is a condition, or situation, or state of being of a group of people characterized by an advanced degree of confusion that has not quite yet reached panic proportions. In this case, the people were not yet panicking about strange sights in the sky. If Arnold hadn't said a word, history probably would have nevertheless been set on a similar course. Someone else's sighting would likely have catalyzed a similar flap—a year later, maybe two, or five. All events unfold in a cultural medium, after all. And the medium of Arnold's time—colored by the fear of outsiders, fear of invasions, and awe of technology, just like today—was fertile ufological ground. Perhaps, in a world without Arnold's encounter, people would have described the phenomenon differently. Perhaps we wouldn't have the term flying saucer at all. Maybe it would have been pancakes or spheres. But Arnold and saucers are what we've got. So the flap that followed—and, really, all flaps to follow—bear his imprint, however faint.",

    "title": "UFO reports and atomic sites",
    "summary": "Since 1947, United States media coverage has speculated that UFO reports might be linked to atomic sites. In June 1947, the start of the Cold War led to domestic UFO reports being taken seriously by both military and media. On July 6, 1947, media nationwide claimed that the ongoing flying saucer craze was linked to transmutation of atomic energy, though experts later dismissed that claim as gibberish. In 1968, Air Force debunker J. Allen Hynek, still reeling from public derision over his claim that a UFO report was caused by swamp gas, floated the suggestion that reports might be tied to atomic phenomenon. By the 1990s, legends had spread of UFOs interfering with a missile test and taking a nuclear missile complex offline. In the 1964 missile test, deployment of then-classified decoy warheads had been mistaken for UFO interference by a witness who was sworn to silence. In 1967, a routine missile complex malfunction happened to coincide with a UFO report. Both anecdotal observations and statistical studies suggest that UFO reports are more common near military or atomic sites. The Air Force conducted a rudimentary spatial analysis in the 1950s that seemed to confirm increased UFO reporting around technologically interesting sites. In 2015, French economists provided the first publicly available statistical analysis confirming that, within their dataset of sightings over France, reports of UFO were correlated with atomic sites to a degree that was highly significant. Experts argue this link could simply be due to the unprecedented scrutiny of airspace around strategically important sites, while believers in extraterrestrial space visitors have long suggested that benevolent aliens were concerned about human use of atomic weapons.",

They note the evolving contents of abduction claims and the apparent effect of culture on the details of the narratives as evidence that the phenomenon is a purely subjective experience. Skeptics also point out the likelihood of large numbers of hoaxes being present in the abduction literature.

Stanley Cohen, who developed the term, states that moral panic happens when a condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests. While the issues identified may be real, the claims exaggerate the seriousness, extent, typicality and inevitability of harm. Moral panics are now studied in sociology and criminology, media studies, and cultural studies. It is often academically considered irrational (see Cohen's model of moral panic, below). Examples of moral panic include the belief in widespread abduction of children by predatory pedophiles and belief in ritual abuse of women and children by Satanic cults. Some moral panics can become embedded in standard political discourse, which include concepts such as the Red Scare and terrorism.

Preparations may anticipate short-term scenarios or long-term, on scales ranging from personal adversity, to local disruption of services, to international or global catastrophe. There is no bright line dividing general emergency preparedness from prepping in the form of survivalism (these concepts are a spectrum), but a qualitative distinction is often recognized whereby preppers/survivalists prepare especially extensively because they have higher estimations of the risk of catastrophes happening. Nonetheless, prepping can be as limited as preparing for a personal emergency (such as losing one's job, storm damage to one's home, or getting lost in wooded terrain), or it can be as extensive as a personal identity or collective identity with a devoted lifestyle. Survivalism emphasises self-reliance, stockpiling supplies, and gaining survival knowledge and skills. The stockpiling of supplies is itself a wide spectrum, from survival kits (ready bags, bug-out bags) to entire bunkers in extreme cases.

Nuclear war is an often-predicted cause of the extinction of humankind. Human extinction or omnicide is the end of the human species, either by population decline due to extraneous natural causes, such as an asteroid impact or large-scale volcanism, or via anthropogenic destruction (self-extinction). Some of the many possible contributors to anthropogenic hazard are climate change, global nuclear annihilation, biological warfare, weapons of mass destruction, and ecological collapse. Other scenarios center on emerging technologies, such as advanced artificial intelligence, biotechnology, or self-replicating nanobots. The scientific consensus is that there is a relatively low risk of near-term human extinction due to natural causes. The likelihood of human extinction through humankind's own activities, however, is a current area of research and debate.",

One example of a visionary is Hildegard of Bingen, a 12th-century artist and Catholic saint.[3] Other visionaries in religion include St Bernadette (1844-1879) and Joseph Smith (1805-1844), said to have had visions of and to have communed with the Blessed Virgin and the Angel Moroni, respectively. There is also the case of the Targum Jonathan, which was produced in antiquity and served as the targum to the Nevi'im. It described the significance of the turban or a diadem to indicate a capability on the part of Jewish priests to become agents of visionary experience.

After the 1920s, the Oxfordian theory became the most popular alternative Shakespeare authorship theory. The convergence of documentary evidence of the type used by academics for authorial attribution – title pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and official records – sufficiently establishes Shakespeare's authorship for the overwhelming majority of Shakespeare scholars and literary historians, and no such documentary evidence links Oxford to Shakespeare's works.  Oxfordians, however, reject the historical record and claim that circumstantial evidence supports Oxford’s authorship, proposing that the contradictory historical evidence is part of a conspiracy that falsified the record to protect the identity of the real author.  Scholarly literary specialists consider the Oxfordian method of interpreting the plays and poems as grounded in an autobiographical fallacy, and argue that using his works to infer and construct a hypothetical author's biography is both unreliable and logically unsound.

Researchers note that the Neon Door Paradox achieved rapid spread through cross-platform reposts and its simplicity, allowing users to localize it to personal contexts with minimal cognitive load.
